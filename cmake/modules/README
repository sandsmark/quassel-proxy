Most of these modules have been copied from KDE's repository.

Files starting with Quassel* are solely created by us.

Below is the contents of KDE's original README:

--------8<--------------------------------------------------------------
these are additional cmake modules required for compiling KDE3 or KDE4
applications with cmake. Some of them are enhanced versions of the files
coming with cmake, some of them are NOT yet part of cmake.
To use them, copy them into the cmake Module directory or
run "cmake ."  followed by "make install"
